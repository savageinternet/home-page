        Valkyrie received her PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley for work on 3D printing interactive devices like video game controllers. She has years of experience working with hardware and electronics, as well as tools ranging from digital fabrication machines &ndash; like 3D printers and laser cutters &ndash; to hand and power tools. She spent two semesters teaching Berkeley’s Intro User Interface Design course, one as the instructor and one as the head teaching assistant. Valkyrie is comfortable in all stages of the design process, from initial interviews to implementation.

        <h2>Evan Savage, CTO</h2>

        Evan is your quintessential T-shaped developer, with nearly a decade of experience in full-stack web development, backend services, and algorithms design / implementation. He's worked with Facebook, Google, Intel, and a few smaller companies (and research labs!) besides, doing everything from real-time spam detection to interactive data visualization to computer vision.  If it can be built in software, he'll figure out how!
