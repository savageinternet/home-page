        <h2>Evan Savage, CTO</h2>
        <i><a href="mailto:evan@savageinter.net">email me!</a></i><br/><br/>

        Evan is your quintessential T-shaped developer, with nearly a decade of experience in full-stack web development, backend services, and algorithms design / implementation. He's worked with Facebook, Google, Intel, and a few smaller companies (and research labs!) besides, doing everything from real-time spam detection to interactive data visualization to computer vision.  If it can be built in software, he'll figure out how!
